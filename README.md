# Weather Dashboard
The purpose of weather dashboard is for users to be able to obtain detailed information about their searched city regarding temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index.
The information returned from a city search should include current and future forecasted weather information.
The intent is to store city searches so the same information for a city can be reloaded easily when the user returns to the page, and that multiple city info can be viewed 
repeatedly.
